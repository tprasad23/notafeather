Dalip Singh Saund elected as first Indian immigrant to House of Representatives.

Dalip Singh Saund was born in a small village in India. He immigrated to the United States of America to study at UC Berkeley. 

In 1956 Saund's career would span the vocations of mathematician, farmer, author, activist and judge, became the first Indian-American elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, as well as the first - and so far only - Sikh member of Congress.

In the 1940s, Saund helped launch a successful effort to convince the U.S. Congress to pass the Luce-Celler Act of 1946, which granted naturalization rights to Indian immigrants (then sometimes referred to as "Hindus"). After becoming a citizen himself, Saund was elected to a local judgeship in 1952 and then to the U.S. House in 1956. Saund served almost three full terms in Congress before suffering a debilitating stroke in 1962. He died in 1973.
