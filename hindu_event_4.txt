Contrary to the hateful and violent meaning the Swastika has come to take on since its misappropriation by the Nazis, the original Swastika is an ancient and holy symbol of auspiciousness and good fortune. 

It is still commonly used at the entrance of Hindu homes, in temples, and on invitations to auspicious occasions such as weddings and other rites of passage. In Sanskrit, the word is a combination of "Su," meaning "good," and "Asti," meaning "to exist." 

The four limbs of the Hindu Swastika have diverse symbolic meanings: the four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama, Atharva), the four stages of life (Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, Sanyasa), the four goals of life (Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha), the four seasons as well as the four directions.

The Swastika is also a sacred symbol for Buddhist, Jains, and Sikhs as well. Unfortunately, Hitler's usurpation of the Swastika still continues to overshadow the beautiful meaning behind this ancient Hindu symbol.
