Bhagat Singh Thind v US was a US Supreme Court Case which like the Ozawa case revolved around classification of people as 'white' and its implications on citizenship and ultimately land-holding. 

Thind argued Asian Indians were anthropologically "Caucasian" and thus were eligible for citizenship and by extension, landholding. The court conceded that Indians were "Caucasians" and that anthropologists considered them to be of the same race as white Americans, but argued that "It may be true that the blond Scandinavian and the brown Hindu have a common ancestor in the dim reaches of antiquity, but the average man knows perfectly well that there are unmistakable and profound differences between them today."
