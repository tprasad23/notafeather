Hi all, 

Thanks for downloading the official Not a Feather iPhone app, and taking a look around. It's a hope this film will bring awareness and a new understanding of the many "less covered" aspects of the Indian-American story and experience.

It was a long but rewarding road making the film, many thanks to all that made it possible.

Hope you enjoy the bonus information available here!

Thanks, 
Teju Prasad
Director, "Not a Feather, but a Dot"
