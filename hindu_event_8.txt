The Bhagavad Gita or "Song of the Lord" is commonly referred to as the "Hindu Bible." Hinduism does not have a single "Bible" in the sense of Christianity or Islam. However, the Bhagavad Gita is an important text in the Hindu scriptural pantheon as it synthesizes much of the philosophical content in other scriptures.

The Gita takes place in the larger epic, Mahabharata, on the battlefield, where the warrior Arjuna asks Krishna questions surrounding duty, action, devotion and self-realization.

The Gita is comprised of 700 verses, split into 18 chapters, each chapter focusing on a different segment of Hindu philosophy. Some examples are the nature of devotion (Bhakti Yoga), Action and Renunciation (Karma Yoga), Three Qualities of Nature (Guna-traya Vibhaga Yoga).

The Gita has has been translated into many languages and is available worldwide, and will continue to be an important component of the Hindu scriptural collective.
