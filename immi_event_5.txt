The Luce-Celler Act of 1946 was proposed by Republican Clare Booth Luce and Democrat Emanuel Celler in 1943 and signed into law by President Harry Truman on July 2, 1946.

The law granted naturalization rights for Indians and Filipino's, and created an annual quota of 100 immigrants from each community per year.
Upon becoming citizens, these new Americans could own homes and farmland, and petition for family from their nation of birth.
