Congress passed the 1906 Naturalization Act to create the "Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization" (later to be merged into Homeland Security) and put it in charge of "all matters concerning the naturalization of aliens." Although the new bureau was part of the Department of Labor and Commerce initially, and part of the Department of Labor from 1913 to 1940, most of its operations were directed by the Department of Justice, and, in 1940, the bureau was made part of the Justice Department. Under the act of 1906, every petition for naturalization became a case for examination by bureau officials. The act also required all naturalized citizens to learn English.
