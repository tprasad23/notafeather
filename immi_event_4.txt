The 1924 Immigration Act was a more thorough immigration law, that provided for the following:

The quota for immigrants entering the U.S. was set at two percent of the total of any given nation's residents in the U.S. as reported in the 1890 census

After July 1, 1927, the two percent rule was to be replaced by an overall cap of 150,000 immigrants annually and quotas determined by "national origins" as revealed in the 1920 census.

A provision in the 1924 law barred entry to those ineligible for citizenship, effectively ending the immigration of all Asians into the United States and undermining the earlier "Gentlemen's Agreement" with Japan. Efforts by Secretary of State Hughes to change this provision were not successful and actually inflamed the passions of the anti-Japanese press, which was especially strong on the West Coast.
