Most Hindus believe in one, all-pervading Divine Reality, that is, a formless entity called Bramhan. This Divine Reality as One Supreme Being, Ishwara, is worshiped in different manifestations as Krishna, Rama, etc. The three ontological entities in Hindu Philosophy are individual (Jeeva), world (Jagat) and God (Ishwara). 

The Indian philosophical doctrine, Vedanta, describes three possible relations between these entities. The non-dualistic view is that everything is manifestation of Brahman. The qualified non-dualistic view is that the world and all individuals are likened to the body for which the soul is Supreme Being. The dualistic view is that the Supreme Being and individuals are different. (This is similar to the view held by most Abrahamic faiths) However all the three views uphold the uniqueness of all-pervading Brahman.

The Sanskrit hymn, Rig Veda I.164.46:

Ekam sat vipraha bahudha vadanti

Truth is one, the wise describe It by many ways. And just as Hindus believe that Truth is one, called by many names, so too is God called by many names.
