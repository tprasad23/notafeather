The Alien Land Act of 1913, was also known as the "California Land Law" this law had far reaching implications on Asians living in the US at the time. The law banned the ownership of land and property to "aliens ineligible for naturalized citizenship," which at the time included Asian aliens. As a result, Asian immigrants found themselves subjected to this racially discriminative law. Even though the law didn't explicitly state any Asian ethnic group, it nonetheless targeted them. The goal was to eliminate Asian immigrant farmers as a competitive force to white farmers.

The effects of this law on Asian immigrants were profound. It stopped the early generations of Asian immigrants from being entrepreneurs and businessmen. It led to their inability to establish wealth that many European immigrants were able to.
