The three religions Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism can be described as Dharmic as they each have a concept of "governing principles" which exist in the foundation of the faith. These principles are understood as "binding principles" which are intrinsic to the human function rather than strict "edicts" to be followed. These "Dharmic" faiths all have their origin in the Indian subcontinent, and share similarity much in the same way the Abrahamic faiths share similarity with each other.

These three have a concept of reincarnation and afterlife, that is: a cycle of births is repeated until a person has attained liberation from the rebirth cycle through correct thought, speech, and action.

In addition, the three faiths share a similar concept of liberation as being a state of consciousness rather than a geographical or physical attainment. Hinduism calls it moksha which describes a merging with the supreme consciousness or Bramhan. Buddhism refers to it as "Nirvana" which describes a mental stillness and detachment from the illusory and worldly desires. Jainism also utilizes the term "Nirvana" referring to the freedom from karmic bondage.

Finally, the three faiths also hold the innate purity of the human soul and inherent divinity in each being. The struggle is therefore not one of seeking salvation for your sins, rather it is reclaiming our true divine nature which has been corrupted by "Maya" or illusion.
