Yoga is a generic term to describe a spiritual/mental discipline Hindu practice. The term covers a wide array of practices, for example, Bhakti yoga, Raja Yoga, Karma Yoga, and the popularized "Hatha Yoga". Yoga is a way of life that combines both physical and spiritual exercises, entails connection between the body, mind and emotional self. Ashtanga Yoga describes an 8-part decomposition:Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, Samadhi, of which physical posture is a single "limb" (Asana), 
 
In the West, Yoga has largely become an asana-based  practice, in some cases, allowing practitioners to delink it from its Hindu philosophical and spiritual roots.  But a perusal of the best known Yoga texts will demonstrate the contrary. Patajanli has a very small amount of his revered Yoga Sutras describing asana.  The remainder focuses on what is essentially Hindu philosophy.
 
Yet, even when Yoga is practiced solely in the form of an exercise, its Hindu roots cannot be avoided.  As the legendary Yoga guru B.K.S Iyengar points out in his famous Light on Yoga, "Some asanas are also called after Gods of the Hindu pantheon..." Many yoga teachers and students regularly practicing Hanumanasana or Natarajasana continue to deny the Hindu roots of their Yoga practice.
 
In effect, the delinking of Yoga from its Hindu roots disenfranchises Hindus of recognition and appreciation for one of their ancestors' beneficial contributions to civilization and inhibits their ability to promote an accurate and deeper understanding of Hinduism.
