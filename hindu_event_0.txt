The word "Hindu" does not appear prominently in any sacred text, ritual or scripture.

The word was first used by the Persians, then popularized through Western literature during the British colonization period. The word was formed by taking the word "Sindhu" (referring to people east of the Sindhu river) and replacing the "S" with an "H", which was common for generating the Iranic equivalent of an Indo-European word. This appears in other places such as Six/Hex, Sapta/Hapta. 

Currently, Hindu, or Hinduism has been adopted to describe the majority religion of India, but is referred internally as "Sanatana Dharma," loosely translated as: "Everlasting Principles." or principles that guide the totality of existence. Therefore, while the word Hindu has become the popular term to use, it should always be understood in the spirit of Sanatana Dharma.
